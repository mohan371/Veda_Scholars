# Veda Scholars Brand Guidelines

## Logo Usage

### Primary Mark
The Veda Scholars logo is the primary symbol of our brand identity. It represents our commitment to educational excellence and career success.

### Rules of Usage
To maintain brand integrity, please adhere to the following rules:

- **Do not stretch or distort the logo.** Always resize ensuring the original aspect ratio is maintained.
- **Do not rotate the logo.** The logo should always be displayed upright.
- **Do not apply shadows, gradients, or effects.** The logo should remain clean, flat, and professional.
- **Use logo only on dark or neutral backgrounds.** Ensure sufficient contrast for visibility.
- **Maintain clear space.** Keep a clear space around the logo equal to at least the height of the cap icon to prevent clutter.

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop:** Standard size, accompanied by the brand name "Veda Scholars".
- **Tablet:** Slightly reduced size to maintain visual proportion with other elements.
- **Mobile:**
    - Logo should be centered or left-aligned.
    - Brand text may stack below the logo if horizontal space is limited.
    - Ensure readability and touch target size is adequate.
